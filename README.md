# Welcome to the Windows Package Manager Community repo
This repository contains the manifest files for the **Windows Package Manager**.  You are highly encouraged to submit manifests for your favorite application.

The **Windows Package Manager** is an open source client.  You will find the source code [here](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli).

# Submitting a Package
To submit a package to the repository, you should follow these steps:
1) Follow the **Contributing** guidelines below
2) Author a Manifest
3) Test your manifest
4) Submit your PR
5) Respond to any feedback

>Note: Please check that the package's manifest you intend to submit does not already exist in the manifests folder, and that there are no open PRs for it in order to avoid duplicates.

## Authoring a Manifest

The minimal manifest syntax is below. Additional information on writing manifests can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/package/manifest) or on the [v1.0 manifest spec](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/blob/master/doc/ManifestSpecv1.0.md).

Current limitations are:
* One manifest per PR

Be sure the manifest filenames match the `PackageIdentifier` manifest naming conventions and the manifest is located in the folder path matching `manifests\<first lower case letter of publisher>\<publisher>\<package>\<version>\.yaml`

### Using the YAMLCreate.ps1
To help author manifest files, we have provided a YAMLCreate.ps1 powershell script located in the Tools folder.  
The script will prompt you for the URL to the installer, then will prompt you to fill in metadata.

I recommend running the script in the location where you want to produce the manifest file.  For example: `manifests\<publisher>\<package>\`.  After successful completion, it will produce the YAML file.

### Using Windows Package Manager YAML Generator
If you prefer to use a GUI to generate YAML files, you can use the **Windows Package Manager YAML Generator**. It is available as an app [in the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-package-manager-yaml-generator/9p3n60fs22k5) and the code is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/ptorr-msft/WinGetYamlGenerator).

Although the Windows Package Manager YAML Generator can create YAML files with multiple installers, winget does not support more than one installer for now.

## Test your manifest
Now that you have authored your manifest, you should make sure it works as expected.

### Locally
1) Verify the syntax.  You can do that by typing the following command: `winget validate <manifest>`
2) Test the install.  You can do that by installing the manifest: `winget install -m <manifest>`
For more details, see [packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/package).

### In Windows Sandbox
You can use the [`Tools\SandboxTest.ps1`](Tools/SandboxTest.ps1) script for testing a manifest installation in [Windows Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview). The manifest will be also validated.

Just provide the path to manifest as parameter:
```powershell
.\Tools\SandboxTest.ps1 <path-to-manifest>
```

## Submit your PR
With the manifest verified, you will need to submit a PR.  Your manifest should be located in the folder path matching `manifests\<first lower case letter of publisher>\<publisher>\<package>\<version>.yaml`

### Validation Process
The PR request will go through a validation process.  During the process, the PR request will get labels to help drive the validation.
In the event of a failure, the BOT will suggest where the problem is with the submission and assign the PR back to you.  

### Respond to PR feedback
If the PR has been assigned to you, a timer is triggered.  You will have 7 days to resolve the issue, or the PR will be closed automatically by the BOT.  

The installer may be identified as malware. If you believe it's a false positive you can submit the installer to the defender team for analysis from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission).
