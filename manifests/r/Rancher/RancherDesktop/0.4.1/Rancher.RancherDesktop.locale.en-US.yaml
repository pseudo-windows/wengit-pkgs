ShortDescription: Rancher Desktop is an open-source project to bring Kubernetes and container management to the desktop.
Description: Rancher Desktop is an open-source desktop application for Mac and Windows that provides Kubernetes and container management. You can choose the version of Kubernetes you want to run. Container images you build or pull are immediately available for Kubernetes because there is a shared container runtime. Rancher Desktop is built on existing stable tools, such as k3s, while itself providing the glue and user experience to make Kubernetes easy to run and use.
